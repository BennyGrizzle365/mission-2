# Mission two 
## Mission Management
1. Git strategy
2. Feature Management
3. Definition of done
4. Resouces used

### 1. Git Strategy
A git repo has been created, simply named mission-02.

In this project the main branch wont be used for creating and pushing features and completed items.

Any work that is pushed to the mission-02 repo will be identifiable by its unique user story number and branch name.

example:

 _001-Create-NavBar-Section_

 _002-Create-NavBar-Buttons_

 At the beginning of a new work item, a new branch will need to be created off the latest main branch. This will ensure the local version is always upto date with main branch  which should prevent conflicts arising.

### 2. Feature Management

The development of the application will be based on user stories. The user stories are mostly fixed, however if things are making the scope creep then the user story will be reassessed.

Once a user story has beenn completed then it can be marked as done.

Every user story will have a unique id that will be used as a part of pushing changes to the git repo main branch.

### 3. Definition of done
The dod is basically when the user story is completed. there wont be any testing done other than user testing.
